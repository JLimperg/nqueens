# nqueens - An evolutionary solution to the N-Queens problem.

The purpose of this project is the study and implementation of evolutionary
algorithms in a lazy functional language. The work here was developed from an
evolutionary computing course programming project. Of special interest is the
GeneralEvolutionary module, which contains a generalized implementation of
evolutionary algorithms as described in [1].

## Instalation

   1. Install [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack).
